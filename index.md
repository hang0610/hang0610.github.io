<h2 class="h1" style="color: rgb(1,92,171); font-weight: bold;" id="biography">Biography </h2>

Hi! I'm Yuanhang Zhang(张远航). **I'm applying for a MSC/PhD program in Robotics in 2024 fall**. Previously, I received my B.Eng. in Automation from **S**hanghai **J**iao **T**ong **U**niversity(SJTU, Shanghai China) in 2023 and my undergraduate project was advised by [Prof. Hesheng Wang](https://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/wanghesheng). I have a profound interest in Robotics which drives me to explore the field of Robotics through conducting researches and participating various types of competitions related to Unmanned-vehicles and Quadrotors.

During my undergraduate career, I was the leader of programming group in [SJTU VEX](https://sjtu-vex.github.io/). My main role was to design planning and control algorithms for our custom robots. I also led teams of over 10 undergraduates to implement and fine-tune the self-designed algorithms in order to enable our robots to execute predefined tasks faster and more robustly than any other robots in the VEX-U competition.

<!-- During my leisure time, I also enjoy playing basketball, working out, traveling, and photography. These are all indispensable elements that heal my soul☺. -->
<!-- My research interest falls in the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, User-Centered Design, and Accessibility. In my research, I study and design tools to support computer-supported creative work for people with disabilities. Through interviews, observations, and content analysis, my work contributes new understanding of how accessibility unfolds at different stages of computer-supported content creation – from learning the tools to developing professional expertise – and the central role communities of disabled creators play in sustaining access in their skilled work. Drawing on these insights, I design and evaluate tools to scaffold accessible learning opportunities for disabled content creators.   -->

<!-- Previously, I completed my Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) and obtained my Bachelor degree (B.Sc.) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).  

I love traveling and photography. Through my camera and lens, I capture the juxtaposition of nature, architecture, and humans as I travel through places and time. -->

<!-- <h3 class="h2">Understanding Accessibility in Audio Production</h3>
The advent of digital audio workstations and other digital audio tools has brought a critical shift in the audio industry by empowering amateur and professional audio content creators with the necessary means to produce high quality audio content. Yet, we know little about the accessibility of widely used audio production tools for blind and low vision people. Through interviews with 18 blind and low vision audio professionals and hobbyists, I found that accessible audio production involves: piecing together accessible and efficient workflows through a combination of mainstream and custom tools; achieving professional competency through a steep learning curve in which domain knowledge and accessibility are inseparable; and facilitating learning and creating access by engaging in online communities of blind audio enthusiasts. I reflected on the deep entanglement between accessibility and professional competency and conclude with design considerations to inform future development of accessible audio production tools.

<!-- <h3 class="h2">Understanding Peer-To-Peer Support Exchange in an Online Community for Blind Audio Producers</h3>
Exchange of peer-to-peer support in online Q&A communities plays an instrumental role in helping people learn and use complex software tools. While prior work has documented how disabled people support each other in finding accessible practices and workarounds in different contexts, research on understanding their participation in dedicated online Q&A communities has been limited. Through the analysis of 180 conversation threads consisting of 1140 posts in an online text-based Q&A community of blind and low-vision audio producers, I revealed various strategies members in this community use to formulate their queries and provide effective solutions regarding screen reader based navigation of complex graphical user interfaces. I reflected upon my findings to discuss the complexities blind and low-vision software users face in developing a shared understanding during collaborative troubleshooting through textual conversations and reimagine how online Q&A platforms could enhance peer-to-peer instructional support among screen reader users.

<!-- <h3 class="h2">Enhancing Accessible Interactive Tutorial Creation by Blind Audio Producers</h3>
Audio production is a skilled practice that requires mastery in highly complex software and hardware tools. Blind audio producers face a steep learning curve where they must learn multiple inaccessible audio production tools in conjunction with workarounds for screen reader support. Learning audio production is made even more challenging due to a scarcity of educational resources geared towards blind people. Grounded in my formative interviews and observations with seven blind audio production instructors, I designed Tutoria11y, an extension for GarageBand to support blind audio producers in creating accessible, interactive tutorials that screen reader users can follow to receive step-by-step guidance and confirmation of their actions. Findings from my design exploration sessions with five blind instructors highlight how Tutoria11y can support tutorial creation and augment tutorial playback for blind audio producers. I discussed how we can rethink technology’s role as a means to amplify, rather than replace, the knowledge of disabled experts.

<!-- **DESIGNING FOR ACCESSIBILITY IN AUDIO PRODUCTION AMONG BLIND AND LOW VISION PEOPLE**  
*Dissertation Committee: [Anne Marie Piper (chair)](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~ampiper/){:target="_blank"}, Darren Gergle, Marcelo Worsley, and Shaun Kane* 

In this project, I use interviews, observations, and content analysis to understand how people with vision impairments use mainstream and custom-made software and hardware tools to produce audio content. Taking their current work practices into account, I design accessible tools to support accessible learning in audio production tools for blind audio producers.
